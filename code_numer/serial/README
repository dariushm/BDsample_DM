NOTE: to make these, object files must already be compiled in code_RD,
so first must compile e.g. rd_gen_reweightPBC in directory code_RD
to also compile object files.



Calculate survival probability for a pair of molecules using the method of H.X. Zhou.
Each version of the program incorporates rotational motion and/or orientational constraints
on association and loops over initial orientations for each separation


survive_prob.cpp : translational diffusion only, this problem is exactly solvable but
useful for determining accuracy of the numerical approach

survive_prob_nwrite.cpp : same as above, just creates smaller arrays.

survive_prob_rate.cpp : translational diffusion only, this problem is exactly solvable but
useful for determining accuracy of the numerical approach. In this version, it only
calculates survival probability at contact to determine the reaction rate vs. time.



survive_prob_rot_thet.cpp : in addition to translation, one of the proteins rotates
around its COM.

survive_prob_rot2_thet.cpp : in addition to translation, both of the proteins rotate
around their COMS.

survive_prob_rot_orient.cpp : in addition to translation, one of the proteins rotates
around its COM, AND there is an angular dependence on the association via the 
orientation of the rotating molecule

survive_prob_rot2_orient.cpp : in addition to translation, both of the proteins rotate
around their COMS, AND the two molecules have an orientation restriction on
their  association.

survive_prob_rot2_orient2.cpp : in addition to translation, both of the proteins rotate
around their COMS, AND the two molecules have an orientation restriction on
their  association that is different than the one above.

survive_prob_rotfull_orient.cpp : in addition to translation, both of the proteins rotate
around their COMS, AND the two molecules have an orientation restriction on
their  association AND the molecule orientation (not just the leg) is used to determine
association depending on this angle as well.







average_**.cpp : These programs are for analysis, for taking averages over degrees of freedom
